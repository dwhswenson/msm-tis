    "There is another very cool feature about python that is worth noting: generator expressions. Before we used list comprehensions to generate a list of all that we need, but what, if we don't want the whole list at once? Maybe that is impossible because of too much memory and also not desirable? We can do the same thing as above using a generator (although it would only be useful if we had to average over billions of samples). So assume the list of lengths is too large for memory. The summing does not mind to use little pieces so we construct a function that always gives us the next element. These functions are called iterators and to make these iteratore there is syntactic way to create them easily: Instead of square brackets in in list comprehensions use round brackets. So the above example would look like this"

    "Okay, this is more some idea to explain the intricacies with pathmovechanges and their differences to deal just with a single mover that produces samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a simple example a `OneWayShootingMover`. Nice and convenient. It shoots either forward or backward so its acceptance ratio is different from each sub mover. But we can still ask the question : \"What is the acceptance of this joined mover?\" Now it gets tricky. Imagine we made an error and set up the forward and backward mover for different ensembles then the question we can ask is : \"What is the acceptance to either shoot forward in ensemble #1 or backward in ensemble #2 is shot?\" \n",
    "Lets make it more complicated and do two shooting moves in a row. What is now our acceptance? Is it the question that either or the two acceptes a move or both? How to we count if two samples are generated? What does it mean when a forward sample in ensemble #1 AND a backward sample in ensemble #2 is generated?\n",
    "\n",
    "The point I want to make is that while acceptance makes sense for a sample it does not necessarily in the replica context. To be clear: We ALWAYS generate a sample in a Monte Carlo move but it can be exactly the old one.\n",

    "\n",
    "Acceptance does not mean we do not generate, it means the MC move does not move to a new point in our sample space and so convergence will not improve. I assume that the main point is to move around in the space to be samples. So, I could propose (or look in the literature) some things. Some observations that may or may not be true\n",

    "2. We should check this per ensemble. So how often did a submove change the samples in a particular ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In complicated moves we might have to differentiate between likely and unlikely combinations. In a PartialAcceptance move e.g. it is unlikely that all move pass but some will and so the number of attempts is not fixed. Assume we attempt 5 times the same forward mover and continue if one succeded. If we accept the first and reject the second, what is the acceptance probability? It is not 50%, it should be lower. But maybe that does not matter, since number 1 accepted is relative to all other moves and so we could say it has speed one change per step?\n",
