    "## Getting an initial path\n",
    "\n",
    "Path sampling methods require that the user supply an input path for each path ensemble. This means that you must somehow generate a first input path. In general, getting the first input paths for TIS boils down to solving two problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Getting a trajectory that samples the rare event.\n",
    "2. Filling all the path ensembles with acceptable trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since transition paths satisfy all the path ensembles between two states, a common approach is to use the same initial path for all path ensembles (reversing it where necessary). This way, once you've solved problem 1, problem 2 is trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rare path can come from any number of sources. The obvious approach might be to find a transition path from a committor analysis, because this would give you a path that satisfies the true dynamics. However, the initial path doesn't *need* to satisfy the true dynamics of the system (later we can equilibrate the path ensemble anyway). This means that other approaches, such as high-temperature trajectories, can be used for the first path. One of the most widely-used methods to get an initial trajectory is to generate a transition trajectory using metadynamics. However, the downside of using paths that don't satisfy the true dynamics is that it might be harder to get them to equilibrate to the correct path ensemble. It seems that this has been more of a problem with paths from high temperature runs than with paths from metadynamics: in the first metadynamics transition, the barrier region is often quite similar to the native dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a bootstrapping approach, which does create paths satisfying the true dynamics of the system. This bootstrapping is nice because it is quick and convenient, although it works best on smaller systems with less complicated transitions. It works by running normal MD to generate a path that satisfies the innermost interface, and then performing shooting moves in that interface's path ensemble until we have a path that crosses the next interface. Then we switch to the path ensemble for the next interface, and shoot until the path crossing the interface after that. The process continues until we have paths for all interfaces."
