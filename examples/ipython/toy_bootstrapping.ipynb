    "\n",
    "RETIS is a path sampling method: it requires that the user supply an input path for each path ensemble. This means that you must somehow generate a first input path. In general, getting the first input paths for RETIS boils down to solving two problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Getting a trajectory that samples the rare event.\n",
    "2. Filling all the path ensembles with acceptable trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since transition paths satisfy all the path ensembles between two states, a common approach is to use the same initial path for all path ensembles (reversing it where necessary). This way, once you've solved problem 1, problem 2 is trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rare path can come from any number of sources. The obvious approach might be to find a transition path from a committor analysis, because this would give you a path that satisfies the true dynamics. However, the initial path doesn't need to satisfy the true dynamics of the system (later we will equilibrate the path ensemble anyway). This means that other approaches, such as high-temperature trajectories, can be used for the first path. One of the most widely-used methods to get an initial trajectory is to generate a transition trajectory using metadynamics. However, the downside of using paths that don't satisfy the true dynamics is that it might be harder to get them to equilibrate to the correct path ensemble. It seems that this has been more of a problem with paths from high temperature runs than with paths from metadynamics: a path from a modified potential energy surface at the correct temperature seems to equilibrate more easily than a path from the original potential energy surface at an incorrect temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a bootstrapping approach, which does create paths satisfying the true dynamics of the system. This bootstrapping is nice because it is quick and convenient, although it works best on smaller systems with less complicated transitions. It works by running normal MD to generate a path that satisfies the innermost interface, and then performing shooting moves in that interface's path ensemble until we have a path that crosses the next interface. Then we switch to the path ensemble for the next interface, and shoot until the path crossing the interface after that. The process continues until we have paths for all interfaces."

    "This ensemble is a bit complicated, but works in the general case. To understand it, we'll look at the `SequentialEnsemble` segment by segment. One preliminary point is that we need the generated path ensemble to be the same as the accepted path ensemble in this case, meaning that we must define the ensemble entirely in terms of which volumes each segment is in (i.e., using `AllInXEnsemble` and `AllOutXEnsemble`, but not `PartOutXEnsemble` or `PartInXEnsemble`).\n",

    "Start with the first two segments: we start with an optional ensemble outside the state, and then move to an ensemble that is in the state. Since our TIS segment must start in a state, these two ensembles allow us to either start outside the state and then evolve into the state, or to start inside the state. At the end of these two segments, we have the first frame of the TIS ensemble segment, i.e., the frame inside the state that begins the TIS path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have a couple of optional ensembles, followed by an ensemble requiring the segment to be outside the interface. The optional interfaces here are only important if `stateA` and `interface0` represent different volumes. If they represent the same volume (which is the case here) these optional ensembles don't matter. However, if they are different volumes, then there is a space which is outside the state but inside the interface. So the first optional interface represents that space. The next optional interface says that you must then be inside `interface0`: this is in case there is a reentry into the state before you cross the interface. Next, we require that we cross the interface. The last optional ensemble is for segments ouside the state. If there is space between the interface and the state, then after you are no longer outside the interface you might still be outside the state. Finally, the path ends with one frame in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the logic of that, any path that begins anywhere and ends with a segment satisfying the innermost TIS ensemble will be accepted by this ensemble. Furthermore, since the ensemble is defined exclusively in terms of `AllInXEnsemble`s and `AllOutXEnsemble`s, the ensemble of paths generated by forward dynamics (`can_append`) is equivalent to the accepted path ensemble."
