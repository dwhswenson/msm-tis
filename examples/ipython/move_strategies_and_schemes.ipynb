However, this scheme might involve several different strategies (for example, whether you want to do one-way shooting or two-way shooting is one strategy decision, and it each can be combined with either nearest-neightbor replica exchange strategy or all-replica exchange strategy: these strategy decisions are completely independent.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Every `MoveStrategy` therefore has an `ensembles` parameter. If the `ensembles` parameter is not given, it is assumed that the user intended all normal ensembles in the scheme's transitions. Every strategy also has an initialization parameter called `group`. This defines the \"category\" of the move. There are several standard categories (described below), but you can also create custom categories (some examples are given later).\n",

    "\n",
    "Intuitively, we often think of moves in groups: the shooting moves, the replica exchange moves, etc. For organizational and analysis purposes, we include that structure in the `MoveScheme`, and each `MoveStrategy` must declare what groups it applies to. OpenPathSampling allows users to define arbitrary groups (using strings as labels). The standard schemes use the following groups:\n",

For example, one level determines which swaps define the replica exchange strategy to be used (`SIGNATURE`), and another level determines whether the swaps are done as replica exchange or ensemble hopping (`GROUP`). Yet another level creates the structures that determine when to do a replica exchange vs. when to do a shooting move (`GLOBAL`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When building the move decision tree, the strategies are applied in the order of their levels. Each level is given a  numerical value, meaning that it is simple to create custom orderings. Here are the built-in levels, their numeric values, and brief description:\n",

    "The `DefaultStrategy` includes default choices for the probability of making each move type, and then treats all moves within a given type with equal probability. Above, we described how to change the probability of a specific move type; now we're going to discuss changing the probability of a specific move within that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach would be to create a custom `MoveStrategy` at the `GLOBAL` level. However, in this section we're going to use a different paradigm to approach this problem. Instead of using a `MoveStrategy` to change the `MoveScheme`, we will manually modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that this involves really diving into the guts of the `MoveScheme` object, with all the caveats that involves. Although this paradigm can be used in this and other cases, it is only recommended for advanced users.\n",
    "\n",
    "One you've created the move decision tree, you can make any custom modifications to it that you would desire. However, it is important to remember that modifying certain aspects can lead to a nonsensical result. For example, appending a move to a `RandomChoiceMover` without also appending an associated `weight` will lead to nonsense. For the most part, it is better to use `MoveStrategy` objects to modify your move decision tree. But to make your own `MoveStrategy` subclasses, you will need to know how to work with the details of the `MoveScheme` and the move decision tree.\n",
