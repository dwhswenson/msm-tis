    "The main approaches to multiple states in TIS are Multiple State TIS (MSTIS) and Multiple Interface Set TIS (MISTIS). Both are fully supported by OpenPathSampling. In MSTIS, there is one order parameter associated with each state. In MISTIS, there is one order parameter associated with each transitions.\n",

    "\n",
    "* it's easier to study networks where two transitions from a given state are very different\n",

    "* you can easily study a subset of the total transition network\n",

    "## Single Replica Transition Interface Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of TIS is that it doesn't naturally parallelize well. Of course, each trajectory can be parallelized as much as possible. However, one could easily do shooting moves on *all* ensembles at the same time, and parallelize further by putting each trajectory on its own set of nodes. The problem with this is that not all trajectories will take the same amount of time. The path length for each ensemble will be different, and what's more, within each ensemble there is a wide range of path lengths. So if you run shooting moves in all ensembles at the same time, some of your nodes will finish long before the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best approaches which has been developed to fix this problem is Single Replica Transition Interface Sampling (SRTIS), which samples the entire space of ensembles and paths using a single replica. This turns parallelization of RETIS into an embarassingly parallel problem: you can have as many replicas as you would like spread across as many machines as you would like."
