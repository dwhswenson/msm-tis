OpenPathSampling Examples
=========================

This page provides a series of examples, tutorials and recipes to help you
get started with ``openpathsampling``.

Each subsection is a notebook.  To open these notebooks in a "live" IPython
session and execute the documentation interactively, you need to download
the repository and start the IPython notebook.

If you installed `openpathsampling` from source, you will need to navigate
to :code:`path-to-openpathsampling/examples`. The notebook files for these
examples and the notebooks are available in the top level

.. code:: bash

   $ ipython notebook

.. warning:: The pre-filled out notebooks are *far* less fun than running them
             yourself!

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   :glob:

Let us know if you would like to contribute other example notebooks, or have
any suggestions for how these can be improved.
