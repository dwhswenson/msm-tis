# OpenPathSampling Logo

This directory contains several versions of the OpenPathSampling logo. This
includes the logo as used on the website, and also high resolution/vector
versions appropriate for print (e.g., on posters). It includes both plain
logo, and logo with text.

The OPS logo was designed by Thomas Splettstoesser of http://scistyle.com.
