# Tools for Power Users

For common situations, we try to make OpenPathSampling as simple to use as
possible. However, sometimes you want to do something that isn't already
widely practiced. For that, we have developed tools to allow you to create
new approaches without needing to dive fully into software development. In
particular, we have extremely powerful tools for creating new path ensembles
and new path movers.

## Path Ensembles

OpenPathSampling grew out of the idea that commonly used path ensembles
could be seen as set-theoretic combinations of simpler ensembles. This
motivated the development of OpenPathSampling, and later motivated the
development of Path Ensemble Theory to provide the full mathematical
framework for the OpenPathSampling code. Although the mathematics are
complicated, the result is a very easy to use and very powerful approach to
build complicated ensembles from simple ones.

We recommend that anyone working with this level of development become
familiar with the mathematics behind it, because there are subtle pitfalls
to avoid.
